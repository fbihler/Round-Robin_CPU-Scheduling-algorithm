# Round-Robin_CPU-Scheduling-algorithm
***This project is currently under development. For contributions, please contact.***

**Description:**
Console Application in C++ that simulates the Round Robin CPU Scheduling Algorithm**

**Capabilties:**
- Automatically create a sample of processes with randomized Burst Time and Arrival Time based on input constraints
- Create a Scheduling Queue
- Calculate resulting Turnaround Time, Waiting Time and Completion Time

**Skills I have applied:**
- OOP in C++
- Dynamic Programming using Pointers
- Security by Design Principles by employing Encapsualtion techniques
